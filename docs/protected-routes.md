# Protected Routes Testing

## Test 1: Authentication Redirect Tests
- [x] Unauthenticated access test (2024-01-19 16:30 EST)
  - Dashboard redirects to main page (localhost/)
  - Other protected routes redirect to login page (localhost/login)
- [x] Authentication persistence test (2024-01-19 16:30 EST)
  - Loading states noted for improvement (see Future Optimizations in steps.md)

## Test 2: Role-Based Access Tests
- [x] Admin access test (2024-01-19 16:30 EST)
  - Successfully accesses all routes
  - Proper redirection to admin dashboard on login
- [x] Agent access test (2024-01-19 16:30 EST)
  - Successfully accesses tickets and dashboard
  - Blocked from admin routes
  - Proper redirection to tickets on login
- [x] Customer access test (2024-01-19 16:30 EST)
  - Successfully accesses dashboard only
  - Blocked from tickets and admin routes
  - Proper redirection to dashboard on login

## Test 3: Edge Cases
- [x] Session expiry test (2024-01-19 16:30 EST)
  - Token stored in localStorage (expected behavior for development)
  - Successfully redirects to login on expiry
- [ ] Role change test
  - Pending implementation of role management in admin dashboard
  - TODO: Add role management functionality to admin dashboard

## Next Steps
1. Implement role management in admin dashboard:
   - Add user list view
   - Add role modification functionality
   - Add role change confirmation
   - Test role changes in real-time

## Notes
- Token storage: Currently using localStorage for development. This is acceptable for localhost development but should be reviewed for production deployment.
- Loading states: Consider optimizing page transitions and implementing better loading indicators.
- Route behavior: Different redirect behavior for dashboard (/) vs other routes (/login) is intentional due to HomeRoute implementation.

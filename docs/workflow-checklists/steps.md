[Post-MVP features moved to backlog.md]

Missing Core Components:
We have team types defined but no team service implementation
We need team-specific middleware for access control
We need team-specific test suites
Testing Plan:
Implementation Order:
Team Service
Team Middleware
Test Suites
UI Components

Admin Role:
Can view all teams
Can create new teams using the "Create Team" button
Can edit and delete any team
Can add/remove members to any team
Can assign roles (Admin, Team Lead, Agent) when adding members
Team Lead Role:
Can view teams they are a member of
Can edit teams they lead
Can add/remove members to teams they lead
Can assign Agent roles only
Cannot delete teams
Agent Role:
Can view teams they are a member of
Cannot edit or delete teams
Cannot add/remove members
Can view team member list
The team management flow works as follows:
Team Creation (Admin only):
Click "Create Team" button
Fill in team name and description
Submit to create the team
Adding Team Members:
Admin or Team Lead clicks "Add Member" on a team card
Selects a user from the dropdown
Assigns a role (Admin can assign any role, Team Lead can only assign Agent role)
Submits to add the member
Team Lead Creation:
Only Admins can create Team Leads
When adding a member to a team, Admin selects "Team Lead" role
The user becomes a Team Lead for that specific team
Team Management:
Team card shows team details and member count
Clicking "View Members" expands to show the member list
Members are displayed with their roles
Actions (edit, delete, manage members) are shown based on user's role

Main Teams Page (/app/teams):
Accessible to all users
Shows teams the user is a member of
Team leads can manage their teams
Admins can see and manage all teams
2. Admin Dashboard (/app/admin):
Add a "Team Management" section in the admin dashboard
Quick access to team creation and management
Link to the full teams page for more detailed management

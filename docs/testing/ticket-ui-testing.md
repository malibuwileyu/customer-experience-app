```typescript
describe('CreateTicketModal', () => {
  describe('rendering', () => {
    it('should render all form fields', () => {
      // Test implementation
    })
    
    it('should set initial focus on title field', () => {

    })
  })

  describe('submission', () => {
    it('should handle successful submission', () => {
      // Test implementation
    })
    
    it('should handle submission errors', () => {
      // Test implementation
    })
  })
})
```

### E2E Test Example
```typescript
describe('Ticket Creation', () => {
  it('should create ticket from dashboard', () => {
    cy.visit('/dashboard')
    cy.findByRole('button', { name: /create ticket/i }).click()
    cy.findByRole('dialog').should('be.visible')
    
    // Fill form
    cy.findByLabelText(/title/i).type('Test Ticket')
    cy.findByLabelText(/description/i).type('Test Description')
    cy.findByLabelText(/priority/i).select('high')
    
    // Submit
    cy.findByRole('button', { name: /submit/i }).click()
    
    // Verify
    cy.findByText(/ticket created/i).should('be.visible')
    cy.findByRole('dialog').should('not.exist')
    cy.findByText('Test Ticket').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

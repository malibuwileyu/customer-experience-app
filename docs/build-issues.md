## Summary
All TypeScript errors have been resolved. The build is now completing successfully.

Note: There is a warning about chunk sizes being larger than 500 kB after minification. This is a performance optimization concern that can be addressed in the future by:
- Using dynamic imports for code splitting
- Configuring manual chunks in rollup options
- Adjusting the chunk size warning limit

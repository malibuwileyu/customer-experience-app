# Fullstack Customer Support System BrainLift

## Purpose
This document serves as a reimagined “BrainLift” for a fullstack customer support system. It brings together best practices from React, Supabase, Tailwind, and other modern technologies. Crucially, it emphasizes simple, yet effective architecture using minimal SQL queries, little to no foreign key relationships, and robust row-level security (RLS). The goal: a scalable, test-driven helpdesk or CRM application without the complexities of heavy relational joins.

## Spiky POVs

1. **No-Foreign-Key Architecture**  
   Many production apps rely heavily on foreign keys. In our project, we focus on minimal relationships—we prefer single-table or simplified linking columns to reduce overhead and ease deploys. This approach eliminates painful migrations and complex joins.

2. **Minimal Queries over Complex Joins**  
   Databases can be performance bottlenecks if queries become unmanageable. Writing small, direct queries drastically simplifies debugging and can reduce the chance of data lock conflicts.

3. **Team Collaboration Without Bloat**  
   Simple references (like storing an agent’s user ID) are often enough to tie data together. We rely on triggers, constraints, and RLS to preserve data integrity. This is especially beneficial when real-time changes to tickets or chat logs must remain consistent across multiple roles.

## Truths

1. **TDD is Non-Negotiable**  
   Writing tests first helps us handle difficult data flows (e.g., ticket assignments, load balancing for agents) without overengineering the schema.

2. **Simple Tables Yield Lower Maintenance**  
   Using direct columns rather than foreign keys or advanced relationships means fewer lines of SQL to maintain. Even in a multi-tenant system, row-level security combined with per-user columns is often enough to enforce isolation elegantly.  
   (Source: Supabase docs on RLS)

3. **RLS Over Hardcoded Roles**  
   RLS ensures that user-based or team-based constraints happen server-side. Admin, agent, and customer roles each see only what they must.

## Myths

1. **“You Have to Normalize Everything”**  
   Many believe fully normalized databases are mandatory. In reality, especially for early-stage prototypes and TDD workflows, stabilized columns with minimal references can be more practical.  
   (Source: Real-world experiences in small start-ups)

2. **“Complex Joins Make the App Faster”**  
   Overly complex joins can drag performance. Tools like Supabase provide fast queries, but layering too many relationships makes both the app and the dev process more brittle.  
   (Source: Various developer reports on production Postgres usage)

3. **“Foreign Keys Are the Only Way to Ensure Data Integrity”**  
   Constraints plus RLS can handle much of the enforcement. You can rely on triggers, unique indexes, or carefully tested logic to keep data safe.

## Key Categories

1. **Database Setup & Environment**  
   - Minimal table structure, direct references to user IDs, constraints for integrity  
   - RLS to separate data by user or role  
   - Consolidate environment variables with .env.* files  
   (Source: Supabase environment management docs)

2. **Authentication & Role Management**  
   - Secure sessions with Supabase’s Auth hooks  
   - Early returns in server logic for unauthorized access  
   - Refrain from multiple user role tables—use a single “profiles” or “users” table with role columns  
   (Source: Supabase Auth docs)

3. **TDD & Testing**  
   - Vitest for fast, integrated tests on CRUD flows  
   - React Testing Library for verifying UI states (admin panels, agent dashboards, etc.)  
   - No guesswork in tests: direct queries, minimal mocking  
   (Source: Kent C. Dodds – “Write tests, not too many, mostly integration”)

4. **Ticket & Real-Time Data**  
   - Basic “tickets” table with user, agent, or admin references  
   - Real-time updates from Supabase’s Realtime engine ensure instant ticket visibility  
   - Simple “status” columns and “notes” fields—avoid complicated sub-tables  
   (Source: Supabase examples for real-time triggers)

5. **Admin Portal & Advanced Configuration**  
   - Agents can see only their assigned tickets  
   - Admins can manage all users, but keep separate logic to avoid tangled Authorization checks  
   - Use minimal store structure for state management (e.g., a single admin store)

## Conclusion
By adopting a simpler, test-driven approach, we balance functionality with minimal moving parts. Our preference for direct queries, minimal table relationships, row-level security, and carefully tested flows leads to a maintainable, robust system capable of handling real-time, multi-role interactions without typical relational overhead. This BrainLift stands as a testament to building a modern, scalable helpdesk using small footprints and big insights.

Would you like to:
1. Start implementing the knowledge base system?
2. Begin work on the ticket management system?
3. Add any additional features to the role management system?
4. Work on the non-MVP optimizations?

Note: All implementations are frontend-based, utilizing Supabase as the backend service. No separate backend server is required.
